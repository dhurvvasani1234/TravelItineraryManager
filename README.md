Travel Itinerary Management System
About the Project
The Travel Itinerary Management System is designed to simplify the process of booking and managing travel itineraries for a travel agency. This system allows the creation of travel itineraries that include details such as the passenger's name, departure city, and arrival city. Users can also update their travel plans easily while automatically handling the associated costs and validations.

Features
Create Itinerary: Allows users to enter their travel details, initializing the itinerary with a default ticket cost.
Update Itinerary: Provides functionality to change the departure and arrival cities of an existing itinerary, with a change fee applied automatically.
Validation: Ensures that all input data is valid, such as non-empty names and cities, and that the arrival city is not the same as the departure city.
Cost Management: Calculates the total cost of the itinerary, adding fees as necessary when changes are made.
